# Setup
- This project uses Pipfiles to manage Python dependencies.
  - To install pipenv: [instructions](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv)
  - For more information on Pipfile and Pipfile.lock usage: [documentation](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/basics/)
- Run `pipenv install` in the same directory as the `Pipfile` whose dependencies you want to install.
    - `apk-downloader`, `gpcrawler`, and `privacy` each contain a `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` for their respective dependencies.
    - There are conflicts between the dependencies for the three subdirectories, so it is recommended to use separate environments.
- `setup.cfg` contains formatting rules for development.
    - To lint code, install `pylint` and run `python -m pylint **/*.py **/**/*.py --rcfile=setup.cfg`
